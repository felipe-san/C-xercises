# C-xercises
A repository where I'm willing to upload most - if not all - my C language exercise scripts. Warning: some of the codes won't be entirely written in english, as they are originally submitted to review in portuguese. 

Scripts will be put in directories each containing a "subjects.txt" file showing which C contents we were studying at the time. I think this will help set a timeline and explain what we were able to use then.

Each script will contain a commentary section with the exercise proposal/challenge. It will be right after the ```#include``` section.
